# Solution 1 - frontdoor

*EURECOM - Yavuz AKIN - 3 January 2022*

## Description of the problem

In this challenge we have an application running that connects to a HTTP server with a username and password and if the credentials are corrects receives a flag from the HTTP server. The problem is to retrieve the flag from the server by finding a vulnerability to this system.


## Solution

We decompile the frontdoor.apk using Ghidra and we can see that inside the getFlag function a test user and password are defined. 

We create a new apk and we try to connect to the server similarly to frontdoor.apk by using the testuser we've seen in the decompiled code. That leads us to the flag.
